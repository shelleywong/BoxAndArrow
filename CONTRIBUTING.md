# Contributing to BoxAndArrow

:octocat: Thank you for taking the time to contribute or consider contributions to this project! :+1: :tada: <br>

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this GitHub-hosted project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request. This file is an adaptation of the [Atom CONTRIBUTING.md file](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). While this is not an Atom project, I strive to uphold the [Atom Code of Conduct](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and would expect the same of anyone who chooses to participate. :simple_smile: <br>

## What should I know before I get started?

This began as an individual culminating project for my Master's degree, but it couldn't have been built without the work done by many before me. Some of the code in this repository comes from other GitHub projects: [Emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk) and [JSAV](https://github.com/vkaravir/JSAV/). I have read the `LICENSE` of each project and have tried my best to assign credit where credit is due.

## How can I contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for BoxAndArrow. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.<br>

Before creating bug reports, please check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/shelleywong/BoxAndArrow/issues) for this project, as you might find out that you don't need to create a new report. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible, so the issue can be more quickly resolved. <br>

You may also want to check the repositories for [Emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk) and [JSAV](https://github.com/vkaravir/JSAV/) -- I may not have the latest updates.<br>

> Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### How do I submit a (good) bug report?

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/paste-able snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why**.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating a package) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem with an older version** of the package? Are there any versions in which the problem doesn't happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue**? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* **Does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some**? Local or remote? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?
* **Include details about your configuration and environment**. Check the [README](https://github.com/shelleywong/BoxAndArrow) to see if a discrepancy in these details may be part of the problem.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for my BoxAndArrow repository, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.<br>

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible, including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.<br>

**Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion**:
* Perform a cursory search of the [issues](https://github.com/shelleywong/BoxAndArrow/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/shelleywong/BoxAndArrow/pulls) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
* Keep in mind, the code available in this public repository was built for **educational use**. In the spirit of promoting academic integrity, the examples provided in this repo are kept at a minimum. Please **DO NOT** try to add code to this repository that implements an actual programming assignment. You **ARE** encouraged to download this repository and try new examples on your own, in a private repo.<br>

**How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?**
Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your enhancement suggestion is related to, [create an issue](https://github.com/shelleywong/BoxAndArrow/issues) on the repository and provide the following information:

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/paste-able snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
* Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
* Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most users of this project and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a community package.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

* Maintain the quality of this project
* Fix problems that are important to users
* Engage the community in working toward the best possible version of this project
* Enable a sustainable system for this project to be maintained and for contributions to be reviewed<br>

I may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
